# Pong Game

A modified pong game using SVGs, based on advanced Javascript. This is a good practice on Object-oriented programming and Webpack tool. In this project, I learned how to use classed and objects efficiently. And the Webpack tool is better to deal with this kind of complicated project.  In sum, I got a lot of fun when I implemented this game. Hope you have fun as well.
